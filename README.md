## Description

This project implements two deep learning (DL) models on classifying the modulation formats of various radio frequency (RF) signals. The two DL models are the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), while the radio frequency signals are generated by _GNU Radio software_ and consist of 11 modulation formats (8 digital and 3 analog) at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).
Conducting modulation classification on the RF signals, this work compares the performance of ANN and CNN models at different values of SNR. Plus, this project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique on both ANN and CNN models. The purpose is to observes the trade-off relationship between the classification accuracy and the length of training time
